      <h2>About CCPedigree</h2>
      <p>

        keep track of their dogs â€” from breeders and kennel owners to rescue

        info, or just proud of your pups, CCPedigree helps you stay organized
        and connected to your dogs' stories.

      <h2>A Brief History</h2>
      <p>
        Originally launched as a humble side project by a passionate dog
        breeder, CCPedigree started as a basic tool for tracking canine
        pedigrees. Over time, it grew a small but loyal user base who loved how
        easy it was to use. In 2025, the site was acquired by [@Lars], who saw
        its potential and began rebuilding it from the ground up. The goal:
        modern features, mobile-friendly design, and a welcoming home for every
        kind of dog enthusiast.
